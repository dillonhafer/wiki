## Wiki features

This is my personal collection of useful software development helps gathered over the years from various and random sources. I've aggregated things I use often, are hard to find, or don't exist.

This wiki uses the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax, specifically [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

The wiki itself is actually a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to github. It will be live immediately.

Go ahead and try:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:dillonhafer/wiki.git
```

Wiki pages are normal files, with the `.md` extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

GitHub Flavored Markdown uses [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) to perform language detection and syntax highlighting. You can find out which keywords are valid by perusing [the languages YAML file](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).
