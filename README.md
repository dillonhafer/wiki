# My Software Development Wiki

## Wiki features

This wiki uses the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

The wiki itself is actually a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to github. It will be live immediately.

Go ahead and try:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:dillonhafer/wiki.git
```

Wiki pages are normal files, with the .md extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

You can check out the source of this page to see how that's done, and make sure to bookmark [the vast library of Pygment lexers][lexers], we accept the 'short name' or the 'mimetype' of anything in there.

Have fun!
